### Design principles used
**Disrupts the Continuity**
- The banner and colors disrupts the continuity of the page. 
- It shows that the banner is a different content then the other pages.
**Visual Hierarchy**
- Placed description of Chat Bot at the top of the page.
- This improves the visual hierarchy as it is more prominent than the element in the navbar.
- Events that are related are also related visually.
