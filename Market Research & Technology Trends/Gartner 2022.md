### Data Fabric
- A data fabric is an architecture that facilitates the end-to-end integration of various data pipelines and cloud environments though the use of intelligent and automated systems.
- The value of data has never been more clear. But often, data remains siloed (isolated from others) within applications, which means it’s not being used as effectively as possible. 
- Data fabric integrates data across platforms and users, making data available everywhere it’s needed. 
- Within inbuilt analytics reading metadata, data fabric is able to learn what data is being used. 
- Its real value exists in its ability to make recommendations for more, different and better data, reducing data management by up to 70%

**How It's Used Today:**
The Finnish city of Turku found its innovation held back by gaps in its data. By integrating fragmented data assets, it was able to reuse data, reduce time to market by two-thirds, and create a monetizable data fabric.

### Cybersecurity Mesh
- A **cybersecurity mesh** architecture provides a composable approach to security based on identity to create a scalable and interoperable service. The common integrated structure secures all assets, regardless of location, to enable a security approach that extends across the foundation of IT services
- Organizations now support a variety of technologies in different places, so they need a flexible security solution. 
- Cybersecurity mesh extends to cover identities outside the traditional security perimeter and create a holistic view of the organization. 
- It also helps improve security for remote work. 

**How It's Used Today:**
An organization in the technology space was struggling to create value from its threat intelligence program. Using a cybersecurity mesh approach, they integrated multiple data feeds from distinct security products to better identify and respond more quickly to incidents.

### Privacy-Enhancing Computation (PEC)
- Privacy-enhancing computation (PEC) approaches allow data to be shared across ecosystems, creating value but preserving privacy.
- The real value of data exists not in simply having it, but in how it’s used for AI models, analytics, and insight.
- Approaches includes:
	- Encrypting
	- Splitting 
	- Preprocessing sensitive data to allow it to be handled without compromising confidentiality.

**How It's Used Today**
DeliverFund is a U.S.-based nonprofit with a mission to tackle human trafficking. Its platforms use homomorphic encryption so partners can conduct data searches against its extremely sensitive data, with both the search and the results being encrypted. In this way, partners can submit sensitive queries without having to expose personal or regulated data at any point.
