		2. Process applications that incorporate AI into an organization's workflow to automate processes or improve them by augmenting worker effectiveness.
		3. Insight applications that harness advanced capabilities such as Machine Learning (ML) to uncover insights that inform operational and strategic decisions across an organization.
2. More Empathic, Cognitive and Affective AI
	-  ML algorithmic capabilities augment employee performance, automate increasingly complex workloads, and develop "cognitive agents" that can simulate human thinking and engagement.
	- Cognitive sales agents initiate contact with promising leads, then qualify, follow up and sustain the prospects.
3. Greater Human-machine Collaborations
	- Robots can respond to ambient cues and intentional movements, analyze moods and sentiments and even identify lies.
	- Humanoid robots detects abnormal activities in the environment, and can work alongside humans without physical separation.
4. More Natural Technology Interfaces
	- Mixed Reality (MR) elevates the potential of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Internet-of-Things (IoT) by combining the best of our digital and physical realities.
	- MR adds intelligence to digital content. Taking into account physics, gravity, dimensions and personality, blurring what is real and what is imagined.
5. Greater Use of Codeless Development Tools
	- Squarespace and Wix gives everyday people the power to accomplish tasks as if they are technology experts.
	- Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft are leading the charge in this cloud-based emerging technology solutions and tools, they simplify complexity, making applications and services creation a breeze.
	- These solutions are increasingly based on the microservices architecture, such as AWS's Lambda, Microsoft's Functions and Google's Functions platforms.
6. Digital Platforms and As-a-service Architectures
	- Every service delivery model aims to satisfy different customer needs and to delivery a seamless experience across the customer journey.
7. Cloud Deployment Matures with Hybrid and Multi-Cloud
	- Future of cloud, combining multiple public and private cloud capabilities to create a flexible ecosystem.

8. Blockchain Decentralizes Trust 
	- The traceability and immutability of blockchain allows trust in company's assets or an individual's online identity and reputation.
9. API Economy takes off
	 - APIs allow solutions and systems to communicate with one another.
	 - Exposing technology assets for reuse across and beyond the enterprise.
	 - Can ignite creative new ways for businesses to use existing data, transactions and products.
