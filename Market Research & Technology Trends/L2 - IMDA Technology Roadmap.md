### 9 Technology Trends
1. Pervasive Adoption of AI
	- In the next 3 to 5 years, exponential increase in commercial AI-based application across three major categories:
		1. Product applications that embed AI in products or services to provide end-customer benefits.
		2. Process applications that incorporate AI into an organization's workflow to automate processes or improve them by augmenting worker effectiveness.
		3. Insight applications that harness advanced capabilities such as Machine Learning (ML) to uncover insights that inform operational and strategic decisions across an organization.
2. More Empathic, Cognitive and Affective AI
	-  ML algorithmic capabilities augment employee performance, automate increasingly complex workloads, and develop "cognitive agents" that can simulate human thinking and engagement.
	- Cognitive sales agents initiate contact with promising leads, then qualify, follow up and sustain the prospects.
3. Greater Human-machine Collaborations
	- Robots can respond to ambient cues and intentional movements, analyze moods and sentiments and even identify lies.
	- Humanoid robots detects abnormal activities in the environment, and can work alongside humans without physical separation.
4. More Natural Technology Interfaces
	- Mixed Reality (MR) elevates the potential of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Internet-of-Things (IoT) by combining the best of our digital and physical realities.
	- MR adds intelligence to digital content. Taking into account physics, gravity, dimensions and personality, blurring what is real and what is imagined.
5. Greater Use of Codeless Development Tools
	- SquareS
6. More Seamless Services enabled by XaaS
7. Cloud Deployment Matures with Hybrid and Multi-Cloud
8. Blockchain Decentralizes Trust 
9. API Economy takes off
