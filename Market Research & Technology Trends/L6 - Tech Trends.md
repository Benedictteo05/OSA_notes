- **soft skills** required for data engineering, such as data modeling, collaboration, and continuous learning.
- [Data modeling is linked to **problem-solving**, requiring the ability to identify, think through, debug, and build solutions around challenges
- [Collaboration is a key soft skill for effective teamwork in the data engineering space, since models are often built for others to use](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/chat?udsframed=1&form=SHORUN&clientscopes=chat,noheader,udsedgeshop,channelstable,&shellsig=549d6e47953ba30ddca0e24893659b4322a486fd&setlang=en-US&darkschemeovr=1#sjevt%7CDiscover.Chat.SydneyClickPageCitation%7Cadpclick%7C1%7C4d75173c-ffc3-454e-8cdc-c8a633ec9c2f%7C%7B%22sourceAttributions%22%3A%7B%22providerDisplayName%22%3A%22o%20Importan...%22%2C%22pageType%22%3A%22pdf%22%2C%22pageIndex%22%3A15%2C%22relatedPageUrl%22%3A%22file%253A%252F%252F%252FC%253A%252FUsers%252Fbened%252FDocuments%252FNYP%252FYEAR%2525202%252520SEM%2525202%252FMarket%252520Research%252520%2526%252520Technology%252520trends%252FLinkedinLearning.pdf%22%2C%22lineIndex%22%3A35%2C%22highlightText%22%3A%22o%20Importance%3A%20Since%20models%20are%20o%EF%BF%BDen%20built%20for%20others%20to%20use%2C%20collabora%EF%BF%BDon%20is%20a%20key%20so%EF%BF%BD%20skill%20%5Cr%5Cnfor%20effec%EF%BF%BDve%20teamwork%20in%20the%20data%20engineering%20space.%22%2C%22snippets%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%7D)[2](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/chat?udsframed=1&form=SHORUN&clientscopes=chat,noheader,udsedgeshop,channelstable,&shellsig=549d6e47953ba30ddca0e24893659b4322a486fd&setlang=en-US&darkschemeovr=1#sjevt%7CDiscover.Chat.SydneyClickPageCitation%7Cadpclick%7C1%7C4d75173c-ffc3-454e-8cdc-c8a633ec9c2f%7C%7B%22sourceAttributions%22%3A%7B%22providerDisplayName%22%3A%22o%20Importan...%22%2C%22pageType%22%3A%22pdf%22%2C%22pageIndex%22%3A15%2C%22relatedPageUrl%22%3A%22file%253A%252F%252F%252FC%253A%252FUsers%252Fbened%252FDocuments%252FNYP%252FYEAR%2525202%252520SEM%2525202%252FMarket%252520Research%252520%2526%252520Technology%252520trends%252FLinkedinLearning.pdf%22%2C%22lineIndex%22%3A35%2C%22highlightText%22%3A%22o%20Importance%3A%20Since%20models%20are%20o%EF%BF%BDen%20built%20for%20others%20to%20use%2C%20collabora%EF%BF%BDon%20is%20a%20key%20so%EF%BF%BD%20skill%20%5Cr%5Cnfor%20effec%EF%BF%BDve%20teamwork%20in%20the%20data%20engineering%20space.%22%2C%22snippets%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%7D).
