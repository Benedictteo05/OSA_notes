### Data Fabric
- A data fabric is an architecture that facilitates the end-to-end integration of various data pipelines and cloud environments though the use of intelligent and automated systems.
- The value of data has never been more clear. But often, data remains siloed (isolated from others) within applications, which means it’s not being used as effectively as possible. 
- Data fabric integrates data across platforms and users, making data available everywhere it’s needed. 
- Within inbuilt analytics reading metadata, data fabric is able to learn what data is being used. 
- Its real value exists in its ability to make recommendations for more, different and better data, reducing data management by up to 70%

**How It's Used Today:**
The Finnish city of Turku found its innovation held back by gaps in its data. By integrating fragmented data assets, it was able to reuse data, reduce time to market by two-thirds, and create a monetizable data fabric.

### Cybersecurity Mesh
- A **cybersecurity mesh** architecture provides a composable approach to security based on identity to create a scalable and interoperable service. The common integrated structure secures all assets, regardless of location, to enable a security approach that extends across the foundation of IT services
- Organizations now support a variety of technologies in different places, so they need a flexible security solution. 
- Cybersecurity mesh extends to cover identities outside the traditional security perimeter and create a holistic view of the organization. 
- It also helps improve security for remote work. 

**How It's Used Today:**
An organization in the technology space was struggling to create value from its threat intelligence program. Using a cybersecurity mesh approach, they integrated multiple data feeds from distinct security products to better identify and respond more quickly to incidents.

### Privacy-Enhancing Computation (PEC)
- Privacy-enhancing computation (PEC) approaches allow data to be shared across ecosystems, creating value but preserving privacy.
- The real value of data exists not in simply having it, but in how it’s used for AI models, analytics, and insight.
- Approaches includes:
	- Encrypting
	- Splitting 
	- Preprocessing sensitive data to allow it to be handled without compromising confidentiality.

**How It's Used Today**
DeliverFund is a U.S.-based nonprofit with a mission to tackle human trafficking. Its platforms use homomorphic encryption so partners can conduct data searches against its extremely sensitive data, with both the search and the results being encrypted. In this way, partners can submit sensitive queries without having to expose personal or regulated data at any point.

### Cloud Native Platform
- Cloud-native platforms use the core elasticity and scalability of cloud computing to deliver faster time to value. They reduce dependencies on infrastructure, freeing up time to focus on application functionality instead.
- Lift-and-shift cloud migrations focus on taking legacy workloads and placing them in the cloud.
- Because these workloads weren't designed for cloud, they require a lot of maintenance and don't take advantage of any of the benefits.

**How It's Used Today**
A major Indian bank built a cloud-native platform to create a portfolio of new digital financial services. The bank was able to reduce the time to open an account to just 6 minutes and add instant digital payments.

### Composable Applications
- Development methodology to reuse pieces of code from existing applications, bundled together, to improve other existing applications.
- Fusion teams lack coding skills, be locked into the wrong technologies and are often tasked with fast-paced delivery.
- Composable applications are made up of packaged business capabilities (PBCs) or software-defined business objects.
- E.g. Representing a patient or digital twin 
	- Create reusable modules that fusion teams can self-assemble to rapidly create applications, reducing time to market.
- Centralized around APIs and microservices to increase business efficiency.
- Repurposes individual functional pieces of an application or process that can be separated from the entire application or process. 
- So that more applications with improved functionality and increased purpose can be developed across an entire organization.
- A composable infrastructure that allows for easy reconfiguration allows for dynamic configuration and customization. 
- Able to use smaller pieces of applications on any larger application, no matter where you are in the company.

**How It's Used Today**
Ally Bank has created PBCs representing repeatable capabilities such as fraud alerting, which its fusion teams can assemble in low-code environments, saving over 200,000 hours of manual effort.

### Decision Intelligence
- Organizations must make better decision, faster.
- Improves organizational decision-making by modeling decisions through a framework.
- Fusion teams can manage, evaluate and improve decisions based on learning and feedbacks.
- Integrating data, analytics and AI allows the creation of decision intelligence platforms to support, augment and automate decisions.
- Decision-making potential impacts extend across enterprises, and the lines between strategic, tactical, and operational decisions are blurring.
- Effective decision-making requires business leaders to reframe what is essential, who or what is involved.
	- To rethink how to leverage data and analytics to improve decision-making.
	- Result in new core competency, driving better business outcomes.
- Applying reengineered thought process to the most important and impactful decisions.
- Consider kinds of data needed, what data could be exploited, what pieces of decision-making handled by humans and machines, and determine collaborations that are critical, rather than what you can manage.

**How It's Used Today**
Product-centric organizations can create a competitive edge in strategic product decisions by using decision intelligence to analyze competitor strategies and evaluate historic decisions.
