**OWASP Risk Rating Methodology**
- Risk model: Risk = Likelihood * Impact
	- Step 1: Identifying a risk
		- e.g. OWASP, SANS top 25
	- Step 2: Factors for Estimating Likelihood
		- e.g. Skill level, Motive, Opportunity, Size, Ease of discovery, Ease of Exploit, Awareness, Intrusion detection
	- Step 3: Factors for Estimating Impact
		- e.g. Loss of confidentiality, Loss of integrity, Loss of availability, Loss of accountability, Financial damage, Reputation damage, Non-compliance, Privacy violation
	- Step 4: Determining Severity of the Risk
	- Step 5: Deciding what to Fix 
	- Step 6: Customizing your Risk Rating Model

| Likelihood and impact levels| |
|-----------|-------|
|0 to < 3| Low|
|3 to < 6| Medium|
|6 to 9| High|
