	- Check Bounds
	- Ensure Exception Safety
	- Adopt good programming practices
	- Test and verify - use test tools
	- Request only sufficient privileges
	- Exit safely

### Security Strategies
- Security should be built into applications right from the start.
- Developers, designers, architects and project managers would do well to follow these tried and tested security principles.
- The principles are derived from the $SD^3+C$ strategies

### $SD^3+C$ strategies 

**Secure by Design**
- Developers follow secure coding best practices and implement security features in their application to overcome vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that the software design is secured right from the start.
- Bad software design can make software difficult to secure later.
- e.g. Your application handles s
